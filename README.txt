Class_app is a simple mongodb driven database application that I created to manage classroom students and track attendance. 

In the future I hope to have reporting functionality and alter the database to track attendance along with other classroom metrics.

The application uses node.js, mongodb, express, jade and Twitter Bootstrap frameworks.
