Class_app is a simple mongodb driven database application that I created to manage classroom students and track attendance. 

In the future I hope to have reporting functionality and alter the database to track attendance along with other classroom metrics.

The application uses 

node.js
http://nodejs.org/

mongodb
http://www.mongodb.org/

express
http://expressjs.com/

jade
http://jade-lang.com/

Twitter Bootstrap

frameworks.
